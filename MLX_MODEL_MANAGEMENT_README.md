- **Llama 3.2 3B (4-bit)**: ~1.8GB - Balanced performance (default)
- **Meta Llama 3.1 8B (4-bit)**: Larger, more capable model

### Reasoning Models
- **DeepSeek R1 1.5B (4-bit)**: ~1.0GB - Reasoning-optimized
- **DeepSeek R1 1.5B (8-bit)**: ~1.9GB - Higher precision reasoning
- **DeepSeek R1 Llama 8B (4-bit)**: Large reasoning model

## üöÄ Usage

### For Users

1. **Select MLX Mode**: Toggle to "MLX (Local)" in settings
2. **Choose Model**: Select from available models in the picker
3. **Download**: If not available, initiate download with progress tracking
4. **Use**: Once downloaded, the model is ready for local inference
5. **Manage**: Delete models or check storage usage in settings

### For Developers

```swift
// Get the shared model manager
let modelManager = MLXModelManager.shared

// Check if a model is available
if modelManager.isModelAvailable(model) {
    // Use the model
} else {
    // Download the model
    await modelManager.downloadModel(model)
}

// Monitor download progress
if let progress = modelManager.activeDownloads[modelId] {
    print("Progress: \(progress.percentage * 100)%")
}
```

## üí° Benefits
